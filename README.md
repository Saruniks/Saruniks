6. Business product is as good as it's people's continuous dynamic relationship with it. It was never about hardware, code, marketing, copywriting and etc...
   Proper use of AI helps with the continous dynamic relationship of people and the product. Inpropper use of AI can lead to problems. 
   Here's the timeline of my humble opinions on AI (My opinion is always subject to change).
